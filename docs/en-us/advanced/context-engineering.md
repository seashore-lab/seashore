# Context Engineering

Context engineering is the set of techniques you use to keep prompts within budget while preserving the information that matters.

This is especially important when you have:

- long threads (chat apps)
- tool-heavy agents
- RAG context + conversation history

See the runnable reference: [examples/14-context-engineering.md](../examples/14-context-engineering.md).
