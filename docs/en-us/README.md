# Seashore Documentation

Seashore is a modern TypeScript agent framework designed for building AI-powered applications with:

- ReAct-style agents with tool calling
- Type-safe tool definitions (Zod)
- Unified LLM adapters (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini)
- Workflows for multi-step orchestration
- RAG, memory, storage, and vector database utilities
- Production concerns: observability, evaluation, security, and deployment

If you are new to the project, start here:

- [Quick Start](./quick-start.md)
- [Running Examples](./introduction.md#running-the-examples)

The docs are organized to mirror the monorepo packages and the runnable example set in `examples/src`.
